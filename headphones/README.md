Headphones Landing Page
 I built this landing page to practice my web design and development skills. It is a modern, sleek website designed for a fictional headphone brand called Headphones.
​ The Goal
​My goal was to create a page that feels premium and high-energy. I chose a dark navy background combined with a vibrant coral accent color to make the buttons and icons pop.
​  Inside the webpage
​I broke the page down into five main sections:
• ​The Hero Section: A big, bold header with a person enjoying music. I added a clear "Call to Action" button right at the top.
• ​"What We Do" Section: I used icons to show off different services like sound engineering and music production.
• ​Results Section: A dark-themed area using pentagon shapes to highlight key statistics and growth.
• ​Contact Form: A simple, clean way for users to reach out. I kept the fields minimal to make it easy to use.
• ​Footer: A neat bottom bar with the logo and social media links.
​ Design Choices
• ​Colors: I used a deep navy for the background to give it a "pro" feel and a coral/pink color for the important parts.
• ​Typography: I chose a clean, sans-serif font to keep it readable and modern.
• ​Layout: I focused on keeping plenty of "white space" (or dark space, in this case!) so the page doesn't feel crowded.
​ Tech I Used
• ​HTML5: For the structure of the page.
• ​CSS3: For the styling, including the dark theme and the custom shapes.
• ​Responsive Design: I made sure the page looks good on both big screens and mobile phones.
